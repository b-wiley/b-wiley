Hi There,

I'm Ben, a Solutions Engineer working at a Glean helping clients integrate Generative AI into their business.

At the moment, I am focused on developing Generative AI Applications to deepen my understanding of the ever-evolving world of Artificial Intellience, as it is clearly the future of the tech industry and world.  Over the next several months, I will be publishing different projects that I am working on.

Please don't hesitate to reach out!

In my most recent project, I explore the possibility of automating Request for Proposals (RFP) that my team responds to as a part of our sales cycles using Generative AI.  Automating this process will save my team tens, if not hundreds, of hours over the course of the year.  See my work in the following repository: https://github.com/b-wiley/rfp-automation-project
